# HiderJS
A simple JavaScript library that can change the title and favicon of the web page it runs on.
<br>
You can use HiderJS using a CDN by include the following code in your website's head:<br>
```<script src="https://hiderjs.netlify.app/hider.js"></script>```
<br>
You can also just download the ```hider.js``` file and use it how you want to.
<br>
Finally, make sure to look at the example HTML file that uses the CDN to make a simple Hider-enabled disguising website.
